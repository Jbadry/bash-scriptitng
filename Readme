In order for this script to run you need a linux based system(basically BASH).
open your command terminal.
and type" ./eldenring.sh  ".
If it does'nt work make the script executable first by typing "  chmod +x eldenring.sh ".
Now, follow the 3rd step again and run the script.
Once,the script has ended you can run it again and again to play it with different choices next time.





Hope you enjoy!!
