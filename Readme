In order for this script to run you need a linux based system(basically BASH).
open your command terminal.
and type" ./eldenring.sh  ".
if it does'nt works make the script executable first by typing "  chmod +x eldenring.sh ".
Now,again follow the 3rd step and run the script
Once,the script has ended you can run it again and again to play it again and again.





Hope you enjoy!!
